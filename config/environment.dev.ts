  topicDescription: `Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer
  technology; everything from the Android, Chrome, Drive, and Google Cloud platforms, to product APIs like the Cast API,
  Maps API, and YouTube API.
  
  A GDG can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch our latest video, to large gatherings
  with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on
  developers and technical content, and the core audience should be developers.`,

    description: `The GDG Organizer Summit brings together GDG organizers attending I/O. With 600+ chapters around the
    world, getting everyone together in one place is hard. Luckily, we have Google I/O to help make that happen. Though
    I/O is happening in Mountain View this year, limited venue and hotel space is sending us 1.5 hrs north to the
    charming city of San Francisco.`,
