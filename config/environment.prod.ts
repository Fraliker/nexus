  topicDescription: `
    AngularJS Meetups are for anyone who is interested in learning about super-heroic web development.
    A meetup can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch the latest video or working on
    getting started tutorials, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like design sprints and
    hackathons. However, at the core, our meetups are focused on web developers and technical content.
